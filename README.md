# CMR-Guidance-and-Navigation
Sample codebase for common midpoint radar (CMR) operation with UAS.

Includes control algorithms for the antenna gimbal. 
GNC algorithms for the vehicle are in separate private repo. 
And, actual flight planning is implemented in GUI using PyQt5 (also, in a private repo).
